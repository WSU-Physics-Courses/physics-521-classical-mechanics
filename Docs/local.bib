	volume = {32},
	year = 2011,
	abstract = {It is a widespread misunderstanding in introductory physics courses that the motion of rolling bodies in general can be calculated using the point of contact as a reference point when equating the rate of change of angular momentum to the torque. In this paper I discuss in general two correct rules to be used instead, in order to derive the equation of motion of rolling bodies, taking moments about the point of contact. I also clarify that the point of contact either can be reckoned the fixed point on the rolling body instantly at the point of contact or the geometrical point defined as the point of contact at any time. Altogether this gives four different ways of deriving the equation of motion with some of them being easier than others depending on the case under consideration. The four different methods are as an illustration applied to a case presented recently by Turner and Turner (2010 Am. J. Phys. 78 905--7).}}

	abstract = {Observable consequences of the hypothesis that the observed universe is a numerical simulation performed on a space-time lattice or grid are explored. The simulation scenario is first motivated by extrapolating current trends in computational resource requirements for lattice QCD into the future. Using the historical development of lattice gauge theory technology as a guide, we assume that our universe is an early numerical simulation and investigate potentially observable consequences. Among the observables that are considered are the muon g - 2 and the current differences between determinations of {\$} {$\backslash$}alpha{\$}, but the most stringent bound on the inverse lattice spacing of the universe, {\$} b\^{}{\{}-1{\}}{$\backslash$}gtrsim 10\^{}{\{}11{\}}{\$}GeV, is derived from the high-energy cut off of the cosmic ray spectrum. The numerical simulation scenario could reveal itself in the distributions of the highest-energy cosmic rays exhibiting a degree of rotational symmetry breaking that reflects the structure of the underlying lattice.}}
