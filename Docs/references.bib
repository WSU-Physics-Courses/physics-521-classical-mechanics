	abstract = {The triumphant vindication of bold theories-are these not the pride and justification of our life's work? -Sherlock Holmes, The Valley of Fear Sir Arthur Conan Doyle The main purpose of our book is to present and explain mathematical methods for obtaining approximate analytical solutions to differential and difference equations that cannot be solved exactly. Our objective is to help young and also establiShed scientists and engineers to build the skills necessary to analyze equations that they encounter in their work. Our presentation is aimed at developing the insights and techniques that are most useful for attacking new problems. We do not emphasize special methods and tricks which work only for the classical transcendental functions; we do not dwell on equations whose exact solutions are known. The mathematical methods discussed in this book are known collectively as asymptotic and perturbative analysis. These are the most useful and powerful methods for finding approximate solutions to equations, but they are difficult to justify rigorously. Thus, we concentrate on the most fruitful aspect of applied analysis; namely, obtaining the answer. We stress care but not rigor. To explain our approach, we compare our goals with those of a freshman calculus course. A beginning calculus course is considered successful if the students have learned how to solve problems using calculus.},

	volume = {32},
	year = 2011,
	abstract = {It is a widespread misunderstanding in introductory physics courses that the motion of rolling bodies in general can be calculated using the point of contact as a reference point when equating the rate of change of angular momentum to the torque. In this paper I discuss in general two correct rules to be used instead, in order to derive the equation of motion of rolling bodies, taking moments about the point of contact. I also clarify that the point of contact either can be reckoned the fixed point on the rolling body instantly at the point of contact or the geometrical point defined as the point of contact at any time. Altogether this gives four different ways of deriving the equation of motion with some of them being easier than others depending on the case under consideration. The four different methods are as an illustration applied to a case presented recently by Turner and Turner (2010 Am. J. Phys. 78 905--7).}}

We prove that the border between these two regimes goes through an exceptional point and we briefly explain what is an exceptional point. The present paper is written for undergraduate students, with some knowledge in classical mechanics, but it may also be of interest for graduate students.},

The question is of interest, because, for a sytem not in thermodynamic equilibrium, entropy should increase strictly monotonically along an orbit, and a negative answer implies that mechanical principles different from those of Hamiltonian mechanics must be introduced to explain thermodynamics. This note answers the question rigorously for Hamiltonian systems confined to an invariant region of finite volume in phase space; it is not possible to define a continuous function which increases monotonically along orbits. An appendix gives a translation of an 1889 paper of Poincar\'e addressing the same issue.},

	abstract = {Interferometry is a prime technique for modern precision measurements. Atoms, unlike light, have significant interactions with electric, magnetic, and gravitational fields, making their use in interferometric applications particularly versatile. Here, we demonstrate atom interferometry to image optical and magnetic potential landscapes over an area exceeding $240 \mu m \times 600 \mu m$. The differential potentials employed in our experiments generate phase imprints in an atom laser that are made visible through a Ramsey pulse sequence. We further demonstrate how advanced pulse sequences can enhance desired imaging features, e.g. to image steep potential gradients. A theoretical discussion is presented that provides a semiclassical analysis and matching numerics.}}

	abstract = {Observable consequences of the hypothesis that the observed universe is a numerical simulation performed on a space-time lattice or grid are explored. The simulation scenario is first motivated by extrapolating current trends in computational resource requirements for lattice QCD into the future. Using the historical development of lattice gauge theory technology as a guide, we assume that our universe is an early numerical simulation and investigate potentially observable consequences. Among the observables that are considered are the muon g - 2 and the current differences between determinations of {\$} {$\backslash$}alpha{\$}, but the most stringent bound on the inverse lattice spacing of the universe, {\$} b\^{}{\{}-1{\}}{$\backslash$}gtrsim 10\^{}{\{}11{\}}{\$}GeV, is derived from the high-energy cut off of the cosmic ray spectrum. The numerical simulation scenario could reveal itself in the distributions of the highest-energy cosmic rays exhibiting a degree of rotational symmetry breaking that reflects the structure of the underlying lattice.}}

	abstract = {Boltzmann-Gibbs statistical mechanics is based on
the entropy $S_{BG}=-k \sum_{i=1}^W p_i \ln p_i$. It
enables a successful thermal approach of ubiquitous
systems, such as those involving short-range
interactions, markovian processes, and, generally
speaking, those systems whose dynamical occupancy of
phase space tends to be ergodic. For systems whose
microscopic dynamics is more complex, it is natural
to expect that the dynamical occupancy of phase
space will have a less trivial structure, for
example a (multi)fractal or hierarchical
geometry. The question naturally arises whether it
is possible to study such systems with concepts and
methods similar to those of standard statistical
mechanics. The answer appears to be {\it yes} for
ubiquitous systems, but the concept of entropy needs
to be adequately generalized. Some classes of such
systems can be satisfactorily approached with the
entropy $S_q=k\frac{1-\sum_{i=1}^W p_i^q}{q-1}$
(with $q \in \cal R$, and $S_1 =S_{BG}$). This
theory is sometimes referred in the literature as
{\it nonextensive statistical mechanics}. We provide
here a brief introduction to the formalism, its
dynamical foundations, and some illustrative
applications. In addition to these, we illustrate
with a few examples the concept of {\it stability}
(or {\it experimental robustness}) introduced by
B. Lesche in 1982 and recently revisited by
S. Abe. }}

consequences and applications of an entropy, $S_q$,
which generalizes the usual Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy
$S_{BG}$ ($S_1=S_{BG}$), basis of the usual
statistical mechanics, well known to be applicable
whenever ergodicity is satisfied at the microscopic
dynamical level. Such entropy $S_q$ is based on the
notion of $q$-exponential and presents properties
not shared by other available alternative
generalizations of $S_{BG}$. The thermodynamics
proposed in this way is generically {\it
nonextensive} in a sense that will be qualified. The
present framework seems to describe quite well a
vast class of natural and artificial systems which
are not ergodic nor close to it. The a priori
calculation of $q$ is necessary to complete the
theory and we present some models where this has
already been achieved. },
