## Course Material

- **Required Textbooks:**

  - [Fetter]
    This textbook provides a concise and thorough introduction to
    classical mechanics, including a discussion of fluids and elastic
    materials that is missing from many other texts.
    We will only cover roughly the first half of the text in this course, but it is a
    worthwhile book to have.
  - [FetterSupp]
    The supplement provides a complete derivation of the Lorenz
    equations - the first example of a chaotic system - and presents a
    derivation of the KAM theorem, demonstrating some modern results
    in classical mechanics.
  - [LL1]: Classic textbook.  Very concise introduction to the key
    concepts in classical mechanics, including some topics omitted
    from other work such as parametric resonances and the adiabatic
    theorem.
  - Additional required readings will be made on [Perusall] with a
    forum for discussion.  Please register with course code: **FORBES-UGAY9**.

- **Supplementary Material:**

  - [Gregory]
    Undergraduate textbook.  Not very insightful, but provides a good
    review and contains quite a few problems.

  - [Fasano]
    Texbook at a comparable level to Fetter and Walecka with many
    problems.  For me, the presentation seems a little formal, and the
    problems seem to interfere with the flow, so I am not sure it is
    the best book to learn from.  It is great, however, for finding
    problems to test ones understanding.

  - [deLange]
    Large collection of problems and solutions including numerical
    problems.  The numerical problems are particularly interest since
    they go beyond what is typically seen in purely analytic texts.

  - [Sussman]
    Quite a different presentation of the core results from a more
    formal perspective with many interesting numerical examples.  The
    notation may not be completely familiar - the authors use
    functional notation and the Scheme programming language.  For
    example, the usual Euler Lagrange equations

    $$
    \providecommand{\diff}[2]{\frac{\mathrm{d}{#1}}{\mathrm{d}{#2}}} \providecommand{\pdiff}[2]{\frac{\partial{#1}}{\partial{#2}}} \diff{}{t} \pdiff{L}{\dot{q}^i} - \pdiff{L}{q^i}
    $$

    becomes

    $$
    D(\partial_2 L\circ \Gamma[q]) - \partial_1L \circ \Gamma[q] = 0 \\ \Gamma[q] = (t, q(t), Dq(t), \dots).
    $$

    The ability to be able to recognize and understand results in a
    slightly different "language" can be extremely valuable for
    checking one's understanding and cementing concepts.  Thus, while
    I do not recommend learning from this text, I highly recommend
    reading it to check that you really understand the concepts.

- **Blackboard:** The course material is hosted on the WSU [Blackboard] system
  <https://learn.wsu.edu>. Check the webpage there for changes to the schedule.

- **Computation Platform:** [SMC].  This will be used for assignment
  distribution and for numerical work.
