# Custom environment variables included in Makefile if this file exists.  The idea is
# that users can customise their experience without committing this file for general
# use.  I use this, for example, to include EXTRAS=all,local which allows me to use
# local installs rather than downloading a copy with hg.
#
# Examples:
#
# Use the locals target in pyproject.toml.
# EXTRAS ?= all,locals
#
# Use a local cookiecutter repo while developing.
# COOKIECUTTER_URL = "~/current/cookiecutters/"
